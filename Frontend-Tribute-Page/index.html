    <h3>About Ulrich Beck</h3>
    <div id="flexbox">
      <div>Ulrich Beck was the most well-known German sociologist and one of the most cited social scientists in the world during his lifetime.</div>
      <div>He was born on May 15, 1944 in Stolp, Germany (now Słupsk, Poland), and grew up in Hannover.</div>
      <div>After studying in Freiburg with a focus on law, he continued his studies of sociology, philosophy, psychology and political science at the University of Munich.</div>
      <div>After appointments as professor at the universities of Münster (1979 - 1981) and Bamberg (1981 - 1992), he became professor of sociology at the University of Munich and also directed its Insitute of Sociology until his death.</div>
      <div>Furthermore, he was appointed professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science as well as the French Fondation Maison des Sciences de L'Homme.</div>
      <div>He coined concepts like Individualization, Reflexive Modernization and (World) Risk Society.</div>
      <div>He collaborated with many other social scientists, including Anthony Giddens and his wife Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim.</div>
      <div>Never growing tired of asking social sciences themselves to overcome their thinking in "Containers" like national borders, he propagated a Cosmopolitan Sociology.</div>
      <div>He died of a heart attack in Munich on January 1, 2015 at the age of 70.</div>
